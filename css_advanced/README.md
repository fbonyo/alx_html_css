# My CSS Advanced Project

This project is the culmination of the CSS Advanced project at ALX. The goal was to build a responsive webpage from a provided Figma design, focusing on styling and layout using only vanilla HTML and CSS.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML**: For the structure and content of the webpage.
* **CSS**: For all styling, including layout, colors, and typography. No external frameworks or libraries were used.

## Design

The design for this project was provided in a Figma file, which guided the layout and aesthetics. All assets, including logos and images, were exported directly from the Figma file.
